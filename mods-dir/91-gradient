More work on gradients, implementing non-scalar numeric values 
as values and variables differentiated w.r.t.

Implements a full version of the facility (but without a few base
functions handling derivatives, and with 'as' for compute gradient
only allowing the actual jacobian).  But does completely naive
forward differentiation.
